# Vending Machine Project
## Motivation
The Vending Machine Business Analytics Project was a full-cycle analytics project born out of the need to understand and optimize vending machine operations during a critical time: the society-wide isolation in Vietnam during April 2020. As people stayed home, vending machines became an essential source of snacks and beverages. Our motivation was to uncover valuable insights that could enhance business efficiency and customer satisfaction.

## Process
In creating our solution, we went through several steps using Microsoft Azure & Power BI:
* Data Collection: We collected raw data from vending machines across different locations.
* Data Cleaning: We cleaned and transformed the data, handling missing values and outliers.
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): We explored patterns, correlations, and trends within the data.
* Dashboard Creation: We built interactive dashboards to visualize key metrics.
* Insights Generation: Our goal was to find insights that met the big, useful, surprising criteria.
